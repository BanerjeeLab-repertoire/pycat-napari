Installation
============

To install PyCAT-Napari, follow the instructions below.

Basic Installation
------------------

1. **Create and activate a new environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n pycat-env python=3.9
   conda activate pycat-env
   ```

2. **Install PyCAT-Napari**:
   ```bash
   pip install pycat-napari
   ```

Platform-Specific Installations
-------------------------------

### Windows
```bash
pip install pycat-napari
```
Note: The application logo may not display correctly on Windows.

### Mac M1/ARM
```bash
pip install "pycat-napari[arm-mac]"
```

Optional Features
-----------------

To install additional features, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Development tools
pip install "pycat-napari[dev]"

# Additional bio-image analysis tools (recommended)
pip install "pycat-napari[devbio-napari]"
```

The `devbio-napari` package adds numerous additional image analysis tools. Learn more at [devbio-napari documentation](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/devbio-napari).

Alternative Installation Methods
-------------------------------

If you encounter issues with the standard installation, use our tested environment files. We provide complete environment files that match our development package setup (no dev tools installed though, please install those separately if you're trying to install a dev version for a fork or pull request):

```bash
# Windows
mamba env create -f pycat-devbio-napari-env-x86-windows.yml

# Mac M1/ARM
mamba env create -f pycat-devbio-napari-env-arm-mac.yml
```

Verifying Installation & Optional Testing
-----------------------------------------

After installation, verify PyCAT-Napari is working correctly:

1. **Basic Checks**:
   ```bash
   # Activate your environment
   conda activate pycat-env

   # Verify Python version
   python --version  # Should show 3.9.x

   # Test basic import
   python -c "import pycat; print('PyCAT import successful!')"

   # Launch GUI (basic smoke test)
   run-pycat  # Should open the GUI window
   ```

2. **Optional Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   # Install test dependencies if you haven't
   pip install "pycat-napari[test]"

   # Run all tests with coverage report
   pytest
   ```

The test suite checks:

- Package imports and resource accessibility
- GUI initialization (non-interactive tests only)
- Core image processing functions
- Data management and file I/O
- Feature analysis tools

ðŸ’¡ Note: GUI-interactive tests are skipped as they require manual interaction.

What Success Looks Like
-----------------------

>- All import tests pass
>- Basic GUI launches without errors
>- Image processing tests complete successfully
>- No failures in core functionality tests

If you encounter any failures, check:

1. Python version (must be 3.9.x)
2. Environment activation
3. Complete installation of dependencies
4. Troubleshooting Guide
5. Check the issues
